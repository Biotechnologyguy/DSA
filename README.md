# My DSA Practice Notebook Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks where I solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit. It serves as my personal space for practicing DSA concepts and solving coding challenges.

## Contents

- Each notebook is organized according to the problem-solving platform (e.g., LeetCode, InterviewBit).
- Within each platform folder, problems are further categorized based on topics or difficulty levels.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks for reference or inspiration. However, please note that this repository is primarily for my personal use, and it's not intended for wider collaboration.

## Feedback

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. However, please understand that I may not actively maintain or update this repository for public use.
